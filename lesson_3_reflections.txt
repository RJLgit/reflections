When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It is useful for keeping your work backed up so you don't lose it all. In addition it is
useful for allowing lots of people to contribute to a project. Lastly, it allows you to
share your work and updates with other people for feedback.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might use your repositary only for changes you are totally sure on or for changes which you are not sure on. This might not match with how you want your local git repositary updated. Manually doing it will give more control to the user.
