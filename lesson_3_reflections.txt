When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It is useful for keeping your work backed up so you don't lose it all. In addition it is
useful for allowing lots of people to contribute to a project. Lastly, it allows you to
share your work and updates with other people for feedback.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might use your repositary only for changes you are totally sure on or for changes which you are not sure on. This might not match with how you want your local git repositary updated. Manually doing it will give more control to the user.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are an invention of github, and it involves copying a github repositary to your profile on github. Clones are where you copy a repositary from somewhere to somewhere else, either locally or between a remote and local location. Branches are where you create a new commit branch to allow different changes to a repositary.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allows you to see where you are out of sync with this remote state. It also allows you to compare between the two states and to merge them whilst resolving the conflict. Lastly, it allows you to work on a remote version whilst offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be much harder to both work on the same file and then merge those changes together to get the best of both worlds. Without github it would be harder to share the files that you are working on. It is also easier to see the changes people make by looking at the difference between commits.
