What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You need to use the git init command to initialize a repository. It will create a .git file which can be checked with the ls -a command. That will store the metadata about your files in the folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where you put files that are ready to be committed. The working directory is the files that you are currently working on in their current state. The repository is just a collection of commits and related files that are commited together.
